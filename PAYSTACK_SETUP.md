# 🇬🇭 Paystack Integration Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've successfully integrated Paystack payment gateway for Ghana and set up your development environment:

### 🔧 Payment Integration
- ✅ **Replaced Stripe with Paystack** for Ghana Cedis (GHS) payments
- ✅ **Created Paystack checkout component** with Ghana-specific features
- ✅ **Added support for multiple payment methods**:
  - 💳 Credit/Debit Cards
  - 🏦 Bank Transfers  
  - 📱 Mobile Money (MTN, Vodafone, AirtelTigo)
  - 🔢 USSD Payments

### 🔐 Environment Setup
- ✅ **Created `.env` file** with your API keys:
  - Paystack Public: `pk_live_c8cdfb75369ffc37b63b363f433522032ba1493e`
  - Paystack Secret: `sk_live_82313d9bb10a23839a829f81c0590f2cf364a010`
  - Airtable Token: `patxsRsdLLGBDmCyk...`

### 🛍️ Mock Development Server
- ✅ **Updated mock server** to support both Stripe (legacy) and Paystack
- ✅ **Ghana-themed sample products** with local company names
- ✅ **Ghana Cedis pricing** (₵800, ₵1200, ₵1500)
- ✅ **Configured API URLs** to use mock server

## 🔄 Production vs Development

### Development (Current Setup):
- Uses mock server with sample data
- Mock Paystack responses for testing
- No real money transactions
- Perfect for development and testing

### Production Setup (Next Steps):
You'll need to configure:
1. **Airtable Base ID and Table Name** in `.env`
2. **Real product data** in your Airtable
3. **Netlify deployment** with environment variables
4. **Paystack webhook URLs** for payment confirmation

---

## 📋 Airtable Setup (Next Steps)

You provided the Airtable token but I need:
1. **Base ID**: Usually starts with `app...` 
2. **Table Name**: The name of your products table

To find these:
1. Go to your Airtable base
2. Click "Help" → "API documentation"
3. Your Base ID will be shown
4. Your table names will be listed

Update `.env` with:
```bash
AIRTABLE_BASE=appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AIRTABLE_TABLE=Products  # or your table name
```

- `functions/paystack-payment-intent.js` - Paystack backend function
