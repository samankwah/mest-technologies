# ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE FIX for 404 Error

## âœ… Solution Ready!

Your Netlify CLI is broken, but I've created a working mock server. Here's how to fix the 404 error:

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Open TWO Terminal Windows

**Terminal 1 - Mock Functions Server:**
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/CRAFT/Desktop/future MEST projects/Frontend/Shoptik-e-Commerce-website-master"
npm run dev:mock
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Simple Mock Server Running!
Mock Functions Server: http://localhost:8888
ðŸŸ¡ Using MOCK data with Ghana Cedis pricing
```

### Step 2: In Terminal 2 - React App

**Terminal 2 - Vite Dev Server:**
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/CRAFT/Desktop/future MEST projects/Frontend/Shoptik-e-Commerce-website-master"
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Update Your App URLs

You need to tell your React app to use the mock server instead of the broken Netlify functions.

**Edit:** `src/utils/constants.jsx`

**Change from:**
```javascript
export const products_url = ".netlify/functions/products"
export const single_product_url = `/.netlify/functions/single-product?id=`
```

**Change to:**
```javascript
export const products_url = "http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/products"
export const single_product_url = `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/single-product?id=`
```

### Step 4: Open Your App

**Go to:** `http://localhost:5173`

**The 404 errors should be GONE!** âœ…
